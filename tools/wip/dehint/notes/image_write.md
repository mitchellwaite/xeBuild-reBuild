# image_write (whole object)

Tools (all compile in about 0.6 s, a sweep of 100 takes 20 s):

- `tools/wip/dehint/iwlib.py <file.c> [-p N|-np] [-v [fn]]`: compile as build.sh does, compare with
  `build/iw/reference.o` (copy of the last matching build/obj/image_write.o; recreate it from a matching
  build). Prints `IDENTICAL` (every byte of the .o) or lines per function, plus any data section that differs.
- `iwtricks.py singles|pairs|greedy|show a,b,c [-o out.c]`: the tricks as named edits. `IWBASE=<file>` picks
  the base source. `iwsubsets.py names...`: every subset.
- `iwsweep.py gen_iwN.py [-n top] [-k label]`: cross product of source edits from a generator; best variant
  goes to `build/iw/gen_iwN_best.c`.
- `iwdump.py <file.c> <dir> <func> [-fdump-...]`: dumps cut down to one function.

## Attempt 1

Landed in `src/image_write.c`, with `sh build.sh` reproducing the SHA256. Where this section says "the draft", start from that
file. README's old count of 18 had 7 dead tests where the source has 8, so the real change is 19 -> 18 tricks; the "17" and "16"
below are off by one in the same way.

### Confirmed

- **buildImage pin (`"b"(bb)`) removed**: 17 tricks. `if (xb.type != BUILD_JTAG) { switch ... } else { jtag }`, plain
  `if (xb.bigBlock)`. `mov ebx,xb.bigBlock; test ebx,ebx` isn't a pseudo: it's peephole2 turning `cmp mem,0`
  into load + test with a scratch from `peep2_find_free_register`, whose search start rotates. Peephole2 walks
  blocks in reverse, so the arm later in the source takes the scratch first: JTAG's `bigBlock` must be
  processed first (edx), then the switch arm (ecx busy, so ebx). **General lever: `mov rX,mem; test rX,rX`
  register differences are block order, not allocation.** gen_iw2.

Result: **18 -> 17, whole object byte-identical to reference.o.** Nothing else removed so far. Near miss:
`drafts/image_write_near.c` (from the draft: pin_end and dead_add2 gone, shapes next=2, t=1, pages=1 in iwanneal's terms)
differs by exactly one `cmp esi,edx` -> `cmp edx,esi` in writeFsTable's big-path (0x2c) copy, with the optimize attribute kept
(`if (ivtmp_273 != _366)` where the reference has `_130 != ivtmp_237`: a version-number order). It'd be 16 if that one flips.
Tried on it without success: 2880 writeFsTable forms (gen_iw15), 2672 random neutral shapes (`IWFIX='{"t":1,"next":2,"pages":1}'
iwrand.py 420 7 pin_end,dead_add2`), annealing 3100 states (iwanneal.py --from). Note pin_end only stops mattering once dead_add2 is gone.

Warning: iwrand/iwanneal only understand names in iwanneal.TRICKS; other names (lab_c1, exp_file) are silently ignored, so a
"hit" on them means nothing. README counts 7 dead tests; the source has 8 (6 imgAdd + 2 imgAddFile).

### What to try next

1. The near miss: anything that makes the end value's SSA version lower than the iv's in the big copy, or try removing dead_add1 or
   dead_add4 too from there (each costs writeFsTable lines: 26 and 50 at best alone, with shapes `range=1, next=2, t=1, pages=3, wf_big, wf_small,
   big_lba, blkvar=2, type0`).
2. Removing all of imgAdd's dead tests loses the off-0 clone (evaluation under 500): needs a natural source of time benefit on off in the loop.
3. imgAddFile fully natural (`gen_iw10`, `lim+ret`, 147 lines; the control flow is mostly right but the error block is 28%, round 2).
4. imgAddMobile (gen_iw8 `v2-gofits`, gen_iw14: 62 lines at best, needs a register fix) and it's goto-heavy, so at best a candidate.

Don't retry: variable reuse for the buildImage pin (no effect, solved anyway), helpers for imgAddMobile, plain-C bodies for dead_add2/4 (gen_iw16, no
exact match with them other than the asm one).

### What removing each trick does (from the draft, other tricks kept)

Lines = differing disassembly lines; `iwtricks.py singles` reproduces this.

| Trick | Lines | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `opt` (no-tree-scev-cprop) | 4 | writeFsTable: `cmp edx,ecx` swapped twice in the small-path (0x30) copy's page loop |
| `pin_end` | 4 | imgAddFile: `end > raw` becomes `raw < end` |
| `pin_t` | 10 | imgAdd: slots of t and partial swap (LRA sorts by frequency; the asm raises t's) |
| `dead_add2` | 12 | imgAdd sched order, writeFsTable compare order |
| `exp_mob` | 26 | imgAddMobile: fits block placed after the else-if block |
| `dead_add1` | 38 | |
| `dead_add4` | 76 | |
| `dead_c1` / `lab_c1` | 180 / 107 | imgAddFile |
| `xmalloc` | 180 | finalizeImage: memcpy prologue gone |
| `dead_lenpp` | 182 | imgAddFile alone; only 8 with pin_end too (`raw < off`, `raw < end`) |
| `lab_lnp2` | 183 | imgAddFile |
| `dead_add3`, `5`, `6` | 170-206 | |
| `pin_hdr` | 243 | finalizeImage |
| `param` | 292 | |
| `exp_file` | 332 | |

Subsets of {opt, pin_end, pin_t, dead_lenpp, dead_add1..6} (1023 tried, `iwsubsets.py`, result in
build/iw/subsets_10.txt): nothing is identical, the differences nearly add up. Best by size: 5 removed
(`opt,pin_end,dead_lenpp,dead_add4,dead_add5`) 28 lines; 8 removed 81 lines; 9 or 10 lose the off-0 clone.

### Mechanics found

- **imgAddMobile's expect + param needs exactly 50/50 on the small path's fits test.** bbro: fits must have
  key >= the else-if traces (edge freq >= 2500, p >= .5) and the shared error block must beat it (p <= .5).
  The predictors: both arms have calls (71/29 cancel), and PRED_TREE_EARLY_RETURN fires on an arm that goes
  straight to the return block unless the arm is the block just before it (`e->dest != bb->next_bb`). In
  natural source the error arm is last, so only fits fires: 39%. Both arms firing cancels to 50, so neither
  may be the last block before the return block. Helpers don't work (not inlined at profile_estimate: bb 2 gets
  71%). Big path after the small one: exact probabilities, but bbro's tie takes the lower-index successor, so small
  comes first (gen_iw6 `first-*`, 137 lines). gen_iw7 (tail after if/else): 99, split_edge then places the
  store block before the tail. gen_iw8 `v2-gofits`, with two gotos: control flow correct, 62 lines, only esi/edi
  and lea/add in the big path. Candidate shape at best (`goto place`, `goto fits`).
- **finalizeImage `pin_hdr`:** the hdr prephi (r201) is the first spill candidate in the region of l5 (pri=1, cost 232),
  so it pops after r189 and takes ebp. The asm adds a use (pri=2, cost 368) and it's no longer first. 195 shapes of
  the ECD loop (gen_iw3, gen_iw4): best 219. To try: shortening r201's range (pri = cost / excess pressure points).
- **`xmalloc`:** CCP sets malloc's alignment only through gimple_call_builtin_p, and bit-CCP keeps it through casts,
  PHIs and +528 steps; no natural form found. Not attacked further.
- **`pin_t`:** r235 = partial's compare, r236 = t. MEM cost 360 vs 267, the asm brings t to 402. Reordering `t`, its type or
  decls is no use (gen_iw9); the forms of `partial` (gen_iw11) give 10 at best.
- **`opt`:** 136t.ldist is the first differing dump: without the attribute sccp leaves loop-exit forwarder blocks (e.g. the FS
  loop's), which changes names later. 60 forms of the loop and calls (gen_iw12, gen_iw13) stay at 4.

## Attempt 2

Written as I go. `drafts/image_write.c` holds the best verified reduction.

- **pin_end removed, whole object identical (18 -> 17)**: `if (end < off && (len & 0x3fff) > 0x3fff) len++;` in imgAddFile. The dead
  len++ test that stays anyway now uses `end`, so `end` lives through the early passes without the asm (gen_iw18 `nopin+L2`). General lever:
  a value kept by an asm output can be kept by a conjunct of a dead test that's staying anyway.
- Near draft's compare: `iw_names.py <dumpdir> writeFsTable [versions]` lists per pass which SSA versions appear/vanish. iv2 (`ivtmp_273`) comes from
  split-paths' copy of the latch, end (`_366`) from ivopts. 2560 forms of the remaining dead tests (gen_iw17) didn't flip it.
- **Dead tests merged (17 -> 16)**: gen_iw19 `m34ob`: `if (x + 0x4000 < first || (len & 0x3fff) > 0x3fff) blocks++;` replaces imgAdd's two dead tests add3 and add4
  (and an empty asm), identical. Merges that aren't identical: m23 (6 lines), m234 (6), m32 (4, writeFsTable).
- **c1's cold label gone (16 -> 15)**: gen_iw21 `ab7`: `if ((end & 0x3fff) > 0x3fff) abort();`. PRED_NORETURN is first-match at 0%, same as PRED_COLD_LABEL. Gimple was equal but for one SSA
  version (npages_128 vs _214 in the big copy, the bad version flips one compare, which flips the loop layout, 116 lines); using `end` in that test fixes it.
- imgAddFile simplified on top: `end` and the `end < off` conjunct are gone again: plain `if ((len & 0x3fff) > 0x3fff) len++;` and, in the fits arm, `if ((len & 0x3fff) > 0x3fff) abort();`
  are identical (gen_iw22 `Lp+Cl`). So pin_end's job is done by the cold->noreturn change. `exp_file` then costs 78 lines rather than 332; PRED_CALL on the error arm gives 71/29 and the expect 50.
- lnp2 removal: gimple identical, only bb freq 630 -> 40 (`if (npages != 0)` guard after `len > 16383`, 15/85 from the hot label vs 45/55): frequency only (183 lines).
- noopt: the 2 small-copy compares flip, gimple otherwise equal: `iw_ifs.py <file> <fn>` shows that sort of thing fast; `iw_passdiff.py` finds the first pass that differs structurally.
- **lnp2 hot label:** `if (partial <= 0) npages = 32;` (gen_iw30 `le`; `partial > 0` too) instead of `!partial` + label: PRED_TREE_OPCODE_POSITIVE gives 73%, the guard block's frequency is 900*(2p-1) = 414 (label: 85% -> 630). Only 12 lines left, in imgAddFile: slots 0x30 (npages) and
  0x34 (off+len) swap. LRA sorts spill slots by frequency, higher frequency = lower address. Needs p higher, or end's references lower. gen_iw31 forms don't do it.
- **pin_t mechanism (better than attempt 1's):** the t test is split by threading in two blocks, 765 and 135, REG_FREQ rounds to 76 + 13 = 89, whereas partial's one test has 900 = 90. So partial wins the slot
  sort by one unit of rounding. The asm adds a use. A def of t earlier gets sunk (gen_iw29 t0: 16 lines). No natural fix yet; with a 50/50 split (no lnp2) it'd be 45 + 45 = 90, a tie that regno decides.
- All three loop dead tests in one if, no empty asm left in imgAdd: `if (x + 0x4000 < first || x > first + 0x4000 || (len & 0x3fff) > 0x3fff) blocks++;` plus `end` in imgAddFile's tests (build/iw/a2/m2D.c): 4 lines in writeFsTable, gen_iw33 sweeps that.

### Attempt 2 result

`drafts/image_write.c`: whole object byte-identical to reference.o with the same flags (`-O3 --param builtin-expect-probability=50`). Removed: `pin_end` asm, `c1` cold label, one dead `if` (add3 + add4 merged; also one empty asm gone).
Count: param 1, dead `if`s 7, pins 2 (t, hdr), expect 2, label 1 (lnp2), optimize 1, xmalloc 1 = **15** (16 if the merged `if`'s two dead conditions are counted as two tests).

Levers that worked, in order of value:
1. **Noreturn call for a cold label.** PRED_NORETURN and PRED_COLD_LABEL are both first-match at 0%. `if (dead) abort();` replaces `if (dead) { c1: cold; name++; }`. Dead arm vanishes before expand, so no `_abort` import.
2. **Merge dead tests** into one `if`: the SSA names are nearly the same. Not every merge works, see gen_iw19 and gen_iw33.
3. **A dead test can keep a value alive** instead of an asm output (`end < off && ...`, gen_iw18). Not needed in the end, but worth retrying elsewhere (filelist_ini, etc.). Check that the value is really initialized.
4. **`partial <= 0` for the 73% PRED_TREE_OPCODE_POSITIVE** (comparisons with 0 via ==/!= get no prediction, `<= 0` does).

Tools added: `iw_names.py` (SSA versions appearing/vanishing per pass), `iw_passdiff.py` (first pass with a structural difference between two dump dirs),
`iw_ifs.py <file> <func> [base]` (final conditionals and bb frequencies; run this first on any big diff: often one compare or one frequency), `iwanneal2.py <secs> <seed> [fixed]` (annealing on the new base, `IWDRAFT=` picks another; log in build/iw/a2).
For slot questions: `grep "Slot . regnos"` in -fdump-rtl-reload-details, then count pseudo refs by bb freq in -fdump-rtl-ira-all (higher freq, lower address; REG_FREQ = freq/10, floored per ref).
Generators: gen_iw17 (dead test forms on near), 18 (pin_end), 19 (merges), 20-22 (abort), 23, 27, 30, 31 (lnp2), 24 (exp_file), 25, 33 (add2/opt with merges), 26 (subsets), 28, 29 (pin_t), 32 (add2 bodies).

Per trick, from this draft (`IWBASE=tools/wip/dehint/drafts/image_write.c iwtricks.py singles`; the old names for pin_end, c1, add3, add4, lenpp no longer apply):

| Trick | Lines | State |
|---|---|---|
| `opt` | 4 | two small-copy compares flip; 1000 random shapes stay at 4; gimple otherwise equal |
| add2 (`x > first + 0x4000`, empty asm) | 12, 2 with shapes | `drafts/image_write_near2.c`: merged into the one `if` (no asm in imgAdd) with `end` in imgAddFile's tests: **one compare off**, same as attempt 1's |
| `pin_t` | 10 | only the two byte slots swap: rounding, see above. Natural fix not found |
| `lnp2` | 183; 12 with `partial <= 0` | `drafts/image_write_nolnp.c`: slots r148 (npages, 8 + guard freq/10) and r136 (off+len, about 57 by my hand count, so the threshold is an estimate) swap. Guard freq = 900(2p-1), p=.73 gives 414, needs >= 500: p >= .78 |
| `exp_file` | 78 (was 332) | PRED_CALL 71/29 on the error arm vs the expect's 50; moving the dead test after the strcpy doesn't help (gen_iw24), and the arm's first block has no call |
| `exp_mob` | 26 | not attempted beyond notes from attempt 1 |
| `xmalloc` | 180 | no natural form; gimple_call_builtin_p needs matching arg types, so a function-pointer cast might avoid it (from memory, untested) but that would be a disguised hint |
| `pin_hdr` | 243 | not attacked |
| a1 / a5 / a6 | 40 / 176 / 66 | see gen_iw26 output; `a1+c3` 18 lines, `a1+a5+a6+len` 28 lines (removes 4!) are the promising subsets |

The writeFsTable compare (`ivtmp_273 != _366`, big copy): `_366` is `end` from ivopts, `ivtmp_273` is the latch copy from split-paths. Both were first popped by cunrolli (360 116 366 273 vs the reference's 195 323 364 351) and released at fre3; in the reference those go to other roles and `end` and the copy get 130 and 237 from the ccp2 batch. So the difference is how deep ivopts reaches into the free list. The list doesn't behave as a pure stack judged from dump appearance (vrp1 pops older names first), so "gone from dump" isn't the release moment. Sweeps: about 2560 (gen_iw17) + 3024 (gen_iw33) on top of attempt 1's 8600 didn't flip it. Forms that only change later passes never change it; it wants a change before cunrolli in writeFsTable's inlined copies.

What I'd try next: (1) `a1+c3` and `a1+a5+a6+len` with `iwanneal2.py` fixed on them; those remove real dead conditions, and every line is a compare or sched order. (2) a p >= .78 predictor for lnp2, or fewer references on r136. (3) Natural forms of a 'first' bb before cunrolli for the near2 compare. (4) exp_mob with a noreturn block placed between the error arm and the return block (makes both arms fire early-return, cancels to 50) but that adds a dead test for one expect, so no net gain unless exp_file goes too, then param goes as well (-3).
Don't retry: plain-C single bodies for add2 (gen_iw32: 8 lines at best), noreturn on lnp2 (gen_iw23), moving t's def (sunk back; gen_iw29), abort for the len++ test (gen_iw22 La, Lb).
