# image_write (whole object)

Tools (all compile in about 0.6 s, a sweep of 100 takes 20 s):

- `tools/wip/dehint/iwlib.py <file.c> [-p N|-np] [-v [fn]]`: compile as build.sh does, compare with
  `build/iw/reference.o` (copy of the last matching build/obj/image_write.o; recreate it from a matching
  build). Prints `IDENTICAL` (every byte of the .o) or lines per function, plus any data section that differs.
- `iwtricks.py singles|pairs|greedy|show a,b,c [-o out.c]`: the tricks as named edits. `IWBASE=<file>` picks
  the base source. `iwsubsets.py names...`: every subset.
- `iwsweep.py gen_iwN.py [-n top] [-k label]`: cross product of source edits from a generator; best variant
  goes to `build/iw/gen_iwN_best.c`.
- `iwdump.py <file.c> <dir> <func> [-fdump-...]`: dumps cut down to one function.

## Attempt 1

Landed in `src/image_write.c`, with `sh build.sh` reproducing the SHA256. Where this section says "the draft", start from that
file. README's old count of 18 had 7 dead tests where the source has 8, so the real change is 19 -> 18 tricks; the "17" and "16"
below are off by one in the same way.

### Confirmed

- **buildImage pin (`"b"(bb)`) removed**: 17 tricks. `if (xb.type != BUILD_JTAG) { switch ... } else { jtag }`, plain
  `if (xb.bigBlock)`. `mov ebx,xb.bigBlock; test ebx,ebx` isn't a pseudo: it's peephole2 turning `cmp mem,0`
  into load + test with a scratch from `peep2_find_free_register`, whose search start rotates. Peephole2 walks
  blocks in reverse, so the arm later in the source takes the scratch first: JTAG's `bigBlock` must be
  processed first (edx), then the switch arm (ecx busy, so ebx). **General lever: `mov rX,mem; test rX,rX`
  register differences are block order, not allocation.** gen_iw2.

Result: **18 -> 17, whole object byte-identical to reference.o.** Nothing else removed so far. Near miss:
`drafts/image_write_near.c` (from the draft: pin_end and dead_add2 gone, shapes next=2, t=1, pages=1 in iwanneal's terms)
differs by exactly one `cmp esi,edx` -> `cmp edx,esi` in writeFsTable's big-path (0x2c) copy, with the optimize attribute kept
(`if (ivtmp_273 != _366)` where the reference has `_130 != ivtmp_237`: a version-number order). It'd be 16 if that one flips.
Tried on it without success: 2880 writeFsTable forms (gen_iw15), 2672 random neutral shapes (`IWFIX='{"t":1,"next":2,"pages":1}'
iwrand.py 420 7 pin_end,dead_add2`), annealing 3100 states (iwanneal.py --from). Note pin_end only stops mattering once dead_add2 is gone.

Warning: iwrand/iwanneal only understand names in iwanneal.TRICKS; other names (lab_c1, exp_file) are silently ignored, so a
"hit" on them means nothing. README counts 7 dead tests; the source has 8 (6 imgAdd + 2 imgAddFile).

### What to try next

1. The near miss: anything that makes the end value's SSA version lower than the iv's in the big copy, or try removing dead_add1 or
   dead_add4 too from there (each costs writeFsTable lines: 26 and 50 at best alone, with shapes `range=1, next=2, t=1, pages=3, wf_big, wf_small,
   big_lba, blkvar=2, type0`).
2. Removing all of imgAdd's dead tests loses the off-0 clone (evaluation under 500): needs a natural source of time benefit on off in the loop.
3. imgAddFile fully natural (`gen_iw10`, `lim+ret`, 147 lines; the control flow is mostly right but the error block is 28%, round 2).
4. imgAddMobile (gen_iw8 `v2-gofits`, gen_iw14: 62 lines at best, needs a register fix) and it's goto-heavy, so at best a candidate.

Don't retry: variable reuse for the buildImage pin (no effect, solved anyway), helpers for imgAddMobile, plain-C bodies for dead_add2/4 (gen_iw16, no
exact match with them other than the asm one).

### What removing each trick does (from the draft, other tricks kept)

Lines = differing disassembly lines; `iwtricks.py singles` reproduces this.

| Trick | Lines | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `opt` (no-tree-scev-cprop) | 4 | writeFsTable: `cmp edx,ecx` swapped twice in the small-path (0x30) copy's page loop |
| `pin_end` | 4 | imgAddFile: `end > raw` becomes `raw < end` |
| `pin_t` | 10 | imgAdd: slots of t and partial swap (LRA sorts by frequency; the asm raises t's) |
| `dead_add2` | 12 | imgAdd sched order, writeFsTable compare order |
| `exp_mob` | 26 | imgAddMobile: fits block placed after the else-if block |
| `dead_add1` | 38 | |
| `dead_add4` | 76 | |
| `dead_c1` / `lab_c1` | 180 / 107 | imgAddFile |
| `xmalloc` | 180 | finalizeImage: memcpy prologue gone |
| `dead_lenpp` | 182 | imgAddFile alone; only 8 with pin_end too (`raw < off`, `raw < end`) |
| `lab_lnp2` | 183 | imgAddFile |
| `dead_add3`, `5`, `6` | 170-206 | |
| `pin_hdr` | 243 | finalizeImage |
| `param` | 292 | |
| `exp_file` | 332 | |

Subsets of {opt, pin_end, pin_t, dead_lenpp, dead_add1..6} (1023 tried, `iwsubsets.py`, result in
build/iw/subsets_10.txt): nothing is identical, the differences nearly add up. Best by size: 5 removed
(`opt,pin_end,dead_lenpp,dead_add4,dead_add5`) 28 lines; 8 removed 81 lines; 9 or 10 lose the off-0 clone.

### Mechanics found

- **imgAddMobile's expect + param needs exactly 50/50 on the small path's fits test.** bbro: fits must have
  key >= the else-if traces (edge freq >= 2500, p >= .5) and the shared error block must beat it (p <= .5).
  The predictors: both arms have calls (71/29 cancel), and PRED_TREE_EARLY_RETURN fires on an arm that goes
  straight to the return block unless the arm is the block just before it (`e->dest != bb->next_bb`). In
  natural source the error arm is last, so only fits fires: 39%. Both arms firing cancels to 50, so neither
  may be the last block before the return block. Helpers don't work (not inlined at profile_estimate: bb 2 gets
  71%). Big path after the small one: exact probabilities, but bbro's tie takes the lower-index successor, so small
  comes first (gen_iw6 `first-*`, 137 lines). gen_iw7 (tail after if/else): 99, split_edge then places the
  store block before the tail. gen_iw8 `v2-gofits`, with two gotos: control flow correct, 62 lines, only esi/edi
  and lea/add in the big path. Candidate shape at best (`goto place`, `goto fits`).
- **finalizeImage `pin_hdr`:** the hdr prephi (r201) is the first spill candidate in the region of l5 (pri=1, cost 232),
  so it pops after r189 and takes ebp. The asm adds a use (pri=2, cost 368) and it's no longer first. 195 shapes of
  the ECD loop (gen_iw3, gen_iw4): best 219. To try: shortening r201's range (pri = cost / excess pressure points).
- **`xmalloc`:** CCP sets malloc's alignment only through gimple_call_builtin_p, and bit-CCP keeps it through casts,
  PHIs and +528 steps; no natural form found. Not attacked further.
- **`pin_t`:** r235 = partial's compare, r236 = t. MEM cost 360 vs 267, the asm brings t to 402. Reordering `t`, its type or
  decls is no use (gen_iw9); the forms of `partial` (gen_iw11) give 10 at best.
- **`opt`:** 136t.ldist is the first differing dump: without the attribute sccp leaves loop-exit forwarder blocks (e.g. the FS
  loop's), which changes names later. 60 forms of the loop and calls (gen_iw12, gen_iw13) stay at 4.
